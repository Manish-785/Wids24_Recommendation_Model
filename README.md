# NLP-Based Recommendation Model

This project provides a structured, intermediate-level approach to building a recommendation model using NLP. The roadmap is divided into four weeks, covering Python basics, NLP foundations, text similarity measures, and model implementation.

## Project Overview

This project aims to implement a recommendation model that leverages text data. Using TF-IDF and similarity measures, the model will recommend items based on textual similarity. This is an ideal project for building foundational skills in Python, data handling, and text processing with NLP.

## Roadmap

### Week 1: Python Basics
- **Goal**: Build a strong foundation in Python and data handling, focusing on text data preparation.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - **Python Fundamentals**: Variables, loops, functions, and data structures (lists, dictionaries).
  - **Pandas for Text Data**: Loading, filtering, and manipulating datasets.
  - **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing common words and phrases with matplotlib.

### Week 2: Introduction to NLP
- **Goal**: Learn essential NLP concepts and begin representing text data numerically.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - **Basic Text Representations**: Bag-of-words and TF-IDF vectorization for text data.
  - **Text Handling in Python**: Reading text data from files and basic text processing.

### Week 3: Text Preprocessing and Similarity Measures
- **Goal**: Gain skills in text preprocessing and measuring text similarity for recommendation purposes.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - **Text Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop word removal, lemmatization, and stemming.
  - **Content-Based Recommendations**: Understanding how recommendations work with text data.
  - **Similarity Measures**: Cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, dot product, and Levenshtein distance.

### Week 4: Recommendation Model Implementation
- **Goal**: Implement, evaluate, and improve the recommendation model.
- **Topics Covered**:
  - **Model Implementation**: Building a content-based recommendation model using TF-IDF and similarity measures.
  - **Model Evaluation**: Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance based on recommendation accuracy.
  - **Model Tuning**: Fine-tuning parameters like similarity thresholds and TF-IDF settings to improve recommendations.
